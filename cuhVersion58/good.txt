Good Instruction Set                         
--------------------
Opcode      Format       Description

 0         ldi s           r0 = s

s is the rightmost 12 bits in the instruction, which can range
from -2048 to 2047 (s is a signed number). 

Also included in the good instruction set are all the trap 
instructions (din, dout, nl, halt, etc.), all of which are 
handled by the sim program, not by microinstructions. 


Microcode
---------

g.sm is the symbolic microcode file you create for the good 
instruction set.

Sign extend by shifting left logically and then shifting right
arithmetically. To shift right arithmetically, use the sra
ALU function.

Test Program gtest.a (no assembler is available)
------------------------------------------------

          ; test program for g.sm microcode        gtest.a
          ldi 7
          dout 
          nl
          ldi -7
          dout 
          nl
          halt

gtest.hex is the the gtest.a program in hex form that you 
create. 

To run gtest.hex, enter

   micro g.sm
   h2b gtest.hex g
   sim gtest.e

Hand in g.lst, gtest.hex, and gtest.log.
