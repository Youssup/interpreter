Fun Instruction Set                         
-------------------

Opcode      Format       Description

 0         ldi  reg, x   reg = x

reg is the three bit field to the immediate right of the
four-bit opcode. It holds the register number of the 
register to be loaded.

x is the rightmost 12 bits in the instruction, which can range
from 0 to 4095 decimal (x is an unsigned number). 

Also included in the fun instruction set are all the trap
instructions (din, dout, nl, halt, etc.), all of which
are handled by the sim program, not by microinstructions.


Microcode File to Create
------------------------

f.sm is the symboic microcode file that your create for the
fun instruction set.


Test Program ftest.a (no assembler is available)
------------------------------------------------

          ; test program for f.sm microcode        ftest.a
          ldi r1, 10    ; load 10 into r1
          dout r1
          nl
          ldi r2, 20    ; load 20 into r2
          dout r2
          nl
          ldi r3, 30    ; load 30 into r3
          dout r3
          nl
          ldi r4, 40    ; load 40 into r4
          dout r4
          nl
          ldi r5, 50    ; load 50 into r5
          dout r5
          nl
          ldi r6, 60    ; load 60 into r6
          dout r6
          nl
          ldi r7, 70    ; load 70 into r7
          dout r7
          nl
          halt

ftest.hex is the ftest.a program in hex form that you create. 

To run ftest.hex, enter

     micro f.sm
     h2b ftest.hex f
     sim ftest.e

Hand in f.lst, ftest.hex, ftest.log
