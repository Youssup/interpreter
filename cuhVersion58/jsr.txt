Jsr Instruction Set                         
--------------------
Opcode      Format       Description

 8         jsr x      r7 = pc; pc = x
 4         ret        pc = r7
 2         ldi x      r0 = x

x is the rightmost 12 bits in the instruction, which can range
from 0 to 4095 (x is an unsigned number).

Also included in the jsr instruction set are all the trap
instructions (din, dout, nl, halt, etc.), all of which
are handled by the sim program, not by microinstructions.


Microcode
---------

j.sm is the symbolic microcode file you create for the jsr 
instruction set.


Test Program jtest.a (no assembler is available)
------------------------------------------------

          ; test program for j.sm microcode        jtest.a
          jsr sub1
          dout
          nl
          jsr sub2
          dout
          nl
          halt

sub1:     ldi 5
          ret
sub2:     ldi 7
          ret

jtest.hex is the jtest.a program in hex form that you create.

To run jtest.hex, enter

   micro j.sm
   h2b jtest.hex j
   sim jtest.e

Hand in j.lst, jtest.hex, and jtest.log
