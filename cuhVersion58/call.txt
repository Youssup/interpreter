Call Instruction Set                         
--------------------
Opcode      Format       Description

 8         call x     mem[--sp] = pc; pc = x;
 4         ret        pc = mem[sp++]
 2         ldi x      r0 = x

x is the rightmost 12 bits in the instruction, which can range
from 0 to 4095 (x is an unsigned number).

Also included in the call instruction set are all the trap
instructions (din, dout, nl, halt, etc.), all of which
are handled by the sim program, not by microinstructions.
 


Microcode
---------

c.sm is the symbolic microcode file you create for the 
call instruction set. 


Test Program ctest.a (no assembler is available)
------------------------------------------------

          ; test program for c.sm microcode        ctest.a
          call sub1
          dout
          nl
          call sub2
          dout
          nl
          halt

sub1:     ldi 5
          ret
sub2:     ldi 7
          ret

ctest.hex is the ctest.a program in hex form that you create.

To run ctest.hex, enter

   micro c.sm
   h2b ctest.hex c
   sim ctest.e

Hand in c.lst, ctest.hex, and ctest.log
