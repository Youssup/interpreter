================================================================= 

micro assembles microcode in symbolic form to binary (see sim.txt 
for a description of symbolic microcode). 

To invoke micro on Windows, enter on the command line

   micro <symbolic microcode file name>

To invoke micro on OS X, Linux, or Raspbian, enter on the command 
line 

   ./micro <symbolic microcode file name> 

Alternatively, you can invoke a program simply by double clicking 
on its icon. 

The name of the binary microcode file produced by micro has the 
extension ".m" and the same base name as the input file. For 
example, if the input file is "b.sm", the output file is "b.m". 

If a file exists with the same basename as the symbolic microcode 
file and the extension ".cfg", micro will read it in and use it 
as the configuration file (see sim.txt for a description of a 
configuration file).  

Symbolic microinstructions are case insensitive.

The file name for microcode that implements a stack architecture
must start with "s". For a register architecture, it must not
start with "s".
