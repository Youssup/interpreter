Weak Instruction Set                         
--------------------
Opcode      Format       Description

 8         push x     mem[--sp] = x
 4         add        temp = mem[sp++]; r0 = mem[sp]; mem[sp] = r0 + temp  

x is the rightmost 12 bits in the instruction, which can range
from 0 to 4095 (x is an unsigned number). 

temp is the name of one of the register in the LCC that is 
available to hold intermediate values in a computation.

Also included in the weak instruction set are all the trap
instructions (din, dout, nl, halt, etc.), all of which are
handled by the sim program, not by microinstructions. For
this instruction set, dout pops the stack and displays in
decimal the popped value. din pushes the value read in onto
the stack.


Microcode
---------

w.sm is the symbolic microcode file you create for the weak 
instruction set.


Test Program wtest.a (no assembler is available)
------------------------------------------------

          ; test program for w.sm microcode        wtest.a
          push 20
          push 35
          add
          dout
          nl
          halt

wtest.hex is the wtest.a program in hex form that you create.

To run wtest.hex, enter

   micro w.sm
   h2b wtest.hex w
   sim wtest.e

Hand in w.lst, wtest.hex, wtest.log.
