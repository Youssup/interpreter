Nano Instruction Set                         
--------------------
Opcode      Format       Description

 8         ldi   x    r0 = x
 4         mul   x    r0 = r0 * mem[x]
 2         subi  x    r0 = r0 - x
 1         neg        r0 = -r0

x is the rightmost 12 bits in the instruction, which can range
from 0 to 4095 decimal (x is an unsigned number). 

Also included in the nano instruction set are all the trap
instructions (din, dout, nl, halt, etc.), all of which
are handled by the sim program, not by microinstructions.


Microcode
---------

n.sm is the symbolic microcode file you create for the nano 
symbolic instruction set.

To multiply, use the ALU mult function.


Test Program ntest.a (no assembler is available)
------------------------------------------------

          ; test program for n.sm microcode        ntest.a
          ldi 5     ; load 5 into r0
          mul a     ; multiply r0 by word at a
          subi 3    ; subtract 3 from r0
          neg       ; negate (i.e., two's complement) r0
          dout      ; display r0 (displays -7)
          nl        ; move cursor to next line
          halt
a:        .word 2

ntest.hex is the ntest.a program in hex form that you create.

To run ntest.hex, enter

   micro n.sm
   h2b ntest.hex n
   sim ntest.e

Hand in n.lst, ntest.hex, and ntest.log
