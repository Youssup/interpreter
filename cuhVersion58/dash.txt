Dash Instruction Set                         
--------------------
Opcode      Format       Description

 0          ldi s          r0 = s

s is the rightmost 12 bits in the instruction, which can range
from -2048 to 2047. s is a signed number. 

Also included in the dash instruction set are all the trap
instructions (din, dout, nl, halt, etc.), all of which
are handled by the sim program, not by microinstructions.


Microcode
---------

d.sm is the symbolic microcode file you create for the dash 
instruction set.

Sign extend using the ALU function that sign extends (sext). 

See LCCMicrolevelSummary.pdf.


Test Program dtest.a (no assembler is available)
------------------------------------------------

          ; test program for d.sm microcode        dtest.a
          ldi 7
          dout 
          nl
          ldi -7
          dout 
          nl
          halt

dtest.hex is the dtest.a program in hex form that you create. 

To run dtest.hex, enter

   micro d.sm
   h2b dtest.hex d
   sim dtest.e

Hand in d.lst, dtest.hex, and dtest.log.
