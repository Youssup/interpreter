================================================================= 

On Mac, Linux, and Raspberry, start the command line with 
      "./". For example,

      ./h2b e0201.hex


h2b converts a machine code file in hex format to binary. The 
binary file created is not relocatable. That is, it does not have 
the S and A header entries that permit relocation. Thus, if the 
machine program has any absolute addresses, they are not adjusted 
according to the load point, in which case the program will not 
work correctly if the load point is not 0. 

To convert a hex file to b instruction set machine code, 
enter 

   h2b <hex file name>

   or

   h2b <hex file name> b

To convert to s instruction set machine code, enter

   h2b <hex file name> s

To convert to r instruction set machine code, enter

   h2b <hex file name> r 

To convert to any other instruction set machine code, enter 

   h2b <hex file name> <x>

where <x> is the one-character basename of the microcode file. 
<x> can be any character that is legal in a final name. For 
example, if you create a microcode file named u.sm, then for
<x> you should specify u:

   h2b <hex file name> u

If you use an uppercase letter for <x>, the lowercase version
is used.
